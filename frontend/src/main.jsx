  // * notes just to demonstrate that restoreCSRF() is the same process as manually connecting to port 8000 through the browser's console by fetching a new XSRF-TOKEN with a GET request, storing it in cookies, and then logging that token just to see it. i.e. {'XSRF-TOKEN': 'RBk9SR36-vqxLYbxtGyoIO_oBLzY65PNsKa8'}, which gives the client (browser) permission to perform full CRUD on the databse through Express.
  // const token = await restoreCSRF().then((response) => response.json()); // set a valid XSRF-TOKEN and _csrf token, both in cookies.
